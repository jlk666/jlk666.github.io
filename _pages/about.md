I am **Zhuosheng Liu**, a Ph.D. candidate in Food Science and Technology at the University of California, Davis. My specialization lies in the intersection of Food Microbiology, Microbial Genomics, and Applied Bioinformatics, where I leverage machine learning and AI tools to advance the field. Holding an Master's degree in Biotechnology from Columbia University and a Bachelor's degree from UC Davis, I have been recognized for my innovative research, including the application of high-performance machine learning models for pathogenic potential assessment. My work represents a blend of scientific rigor and cutting-edge technology, aiming to enhance food safety and public health. Alongside my research, I serve as a Graduate Teaching Assistant and am actively involved in professional associations.
