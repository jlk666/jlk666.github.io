I am **Zhuosheng Liu**, a Ph.D. candidate in Food Science and Technology at the University of California, Davis. My specialization lies in the intersection of Food Microbiology, Microbial Genomics, and Applied Bioinformatics, where I leverage machine learning and AI tools to advance the field. Holding an Master's degree in Biotechnology from Columbia University and a Bachelor's degree from UC Davis, I have been recognized for my innovative research, including the application of high-performance machine learning models for pathogenic potential assessment. My work represents a blend of scientific rigor and cutting-edge technology, aiming to enhance food safety and public health. Alongside my research, I serve as a Graduate Teaching Assistant and am actively involved in professional associations.

## News:
**October, 2023** My most recent research was accepted by *Microbiology Spectrum*, I will post the code after it is available online. [Full paper](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/spectrum.02783-23)

**September, 2023** I serve as the graduate tutor in ECS 122A algorithm analysis in fall quarter, 2023.
**July, 2023** I am currently constructing website for Spring 2024 FST 104L Food Microbiology taught by Dr. Luxin Wang. The progress of website construct can be tracked [here](https://hackmd.io/@g4P5SSbiSriJQ-hJMcd9fg/Hkpb1-EO3). Any valuable advice will be appriciated!
