This project aims to adapt the **Efficient Segment-Anything Model (ESAM)**, developed by Meta AI, for biomedical image segmentation tasks. ESAM is a lightweight version of the Segment-Anything Model (SAM), designed to reduce computational load while maintaining high performance.

Our focus is on leveraging ESAM's capabilities to improve segmentation accuracy and efficiency in complex biomedical imaging scenarios, including MRI and CT scans. Additionally, we plan to integrate a **Vision Language Model (VLM)** to further evaluate and interpret the segmented results.

**Status:** In progress.
