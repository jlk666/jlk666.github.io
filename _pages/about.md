Hello! I'm **Jay** (Zhuosheng) **Liu**, a PhD candidate in Food Microbiology and concurrent MS candidate in Computer Science with a robust quantitative background in bioinformatics and applied machine learning/AI, specifically AI4Science. My work includes developing models based on large-scale amd high-dimensional omics-data to facilitate decision making to prevent microbial hazard and get informational biological insights by enabling ML/AI models be interpretable. Additionally, I have extensive experience in application of visiom/vision language models (e.g. finetuninig CLIP in bacterial image classification and biomedical image segmentation using SAM). This unique blend of skills allows me to bridge the gap between biological sciences and data science, driving innovative solutions and impactful insights in both fields.

## In progress projects/ideas:
1. **[Utilizing the Efficient Segment-Anything Model (ESAM) with visual language models for Enhanced Biomedical Image Segmentation](files/289G_finalReport.pdf)** 
This project aims to adapt the Efficient Segment-Anything Model (ESAM), developed by Meta AI, for biomedical image segmentation tasks. ESAM is a lightweight version of the Segment-Anything Model (SAM), designed to reduce computational load while maintaining high performance. Our focus is on leveraging ESAM's capabilities to improve segmentation accuracy and efficiency in complex biomedical imaging scenarios, including MRI and CT scans. Additionally, we plan to integrate a Vision Language Model (VLM) to further evaluate and interpret the segmented results.
2. **Integrating Artificial Intelligence in Human-Centered Food Systems: Opportunities and Challenges**
This project involves preparing a comprehensive review paper that explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in human-centered food systems. The manuscript aims to identify and discuss the opportunities and challenges presented by the adoption of AI technologies in various aspects of food production, distribution, and consumption.
3. **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Vision-Language Models: Enhancing CLIP with Mixture of Experts**
This project explores the application of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods to Vision-Language models, specifically focusing on CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training). The study introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess the performance of PEFT methods, such as prompt tuning and adapters, across diverse backbones and datasets. The goal is to enhance CLIP's adaptability in complex, multi-modal scenarios by leveraging Mixture of Experts (MOE) and other PEFT techniques.
